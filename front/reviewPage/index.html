          Ross: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The
          Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and
          rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
          Phoebe: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be
          like stealing. Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like
          shopping! Phoebe: Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It
          would be like this giant karmic debt. Rachel: What future boyfriends?

          could have a gallon of Alan. Phoebe: No, but would you like a thousand

          be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you! Ross: Yeah. He could row
          like a viking.
